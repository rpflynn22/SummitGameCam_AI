## Description
This program was designed to leverage Ultralytics's YOLOv8 image classification to expedite SLPT's game camera image processing. It is acknowledged that it
will not be perfect so some human supervision is necessary to classify images that are deemed low-confidence inferences. The neural network file is located
within the yolov8 directory and has been trained using images sourced from iNaturalists public API. Future updates to the model will incorporate SLPT's
image data it has gathered from the game cameras. For any questions about the program, feel free to contact Keane Flynn at the above email address.
